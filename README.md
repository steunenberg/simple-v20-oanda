# simple-v20-oanda
I want to develop a simple Python accessor to the oanda v20 API

This should help me to
- play around more easily with oanda
- concentrate on my practises using Python for Finance (http://www.hilpisch.com/Yves_Python_4_Finance_Contents.pdf )
- practice the usage of Unit Tests and Mocking - as I already notice I tend to forget about that.
